A Library Management System (LMS) is a software application designed to manage and organize the operations of a library efficiently. It helps librarians, staff, and users streamline tasks such as book cataloging, borrowing, returning, and tracking library materials. By automating manual processes, an LMS improves accuracy, reduces paperwork, and enhances the overall user experience. According to itechindia.co, it helps to streamline the process of selecting, ordering, and receiving new materials, ensuring efficient resource addition while avoiding duplicates. These features collectively contribute to the effective management of library operations, benefitting both staff and students by enhancing accessibility and organization.

Modern LMS platforms often include features like digital databases, user authentication, book reservation systems, and fine management. Some even integrate with online resources, making it easier for students, researchers, and book enthusiasts to access information. Whether for schools, universities, or public libraries, an LMS plays a crucial role in maintaining an organized and accessible collection of resources.
